# CO_Assignment_2022

This is a **RISC based assembler and simulator** made as part of our CSE-112 Computer Organization course at IIIT Delhi. The assembler and simulator are written in Python 3.10.

The [Problem Statement](CO%20PROJECT%2022.pdf) enlists the supported instruction set and deliverables of the project.

## Usage
The python script ```assembler.py``` takes input as assembly code and outputs machine code. The python script ```simulator.py``` uses the machine code and outputs the result of the execution of the machine code.

### Assembler

The assembler [script](SimpleAssembler/SimpleAssembler.py) can be run using the following command:

```bash
cd SimpleAssembler
python3 SimpleAssembler.py
```

### Simulator

The simulator [script](SimpleSimulator/SimpleSimulator.py) can be run using the following command:

```bash
cd SimpleSimulator
python3 SimpleSimulator.py
```

## Testing
We have also added a [folder](CSE112-22-Assignment-SimpleAssemblerSimulator) containing the test cases for the assembler and simulator. More information about the test cases and their execution can be found in the [README](CSE112-22-Assignment-SimpleAssemblerSimulator/README.md) file inside the folder.
